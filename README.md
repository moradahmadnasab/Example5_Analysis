## Example 5 Description

In this example, for each value of  
\( n \in \{50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300\} \) (as the size of the problem),  
we consider 64 different problems. These problems are constituted by 8 different matrices **A** and 8 different matrices **B**, both generated by formula 

```matlab
gallery('randsvd', n, -1e^k, MODE)

when **MODE = 3**.  
The condition numbers of the matrices range from about **1e+1** to about **1e+15**.

We solve each problem with fixed **A** and **B** (each one of the 64 problems) by the following six methods:

- **OSDR1 method**
- **RSSEP1 method**
- **OSDR2 method**
- **RSSEP2 method**
- **CQR method**
- **QZ method**

Then, we compute:

\[
\eta_{\text{Mean}}^{\text{Min}} = \min\{\eta_{\text{Mean}}^{\text{OSDR1}}, \eta_{\text{Mean}}^{\text{RSSEP1}}, \eta_{\text{Mean}}^{\text{OSDR2}}, \eta_{\text{Mean}}^{\text{RSSEP2}}, \eta_{\text{Mean}}^{\text{CQR}}, \eta_{\text{Mean}}^{\text{QZ}}\} \quad (29)
\]

For each group of problems with a specific size **n** and a range of condition numbers from about **1e+1** to about **1e+15** (for **A**s and **B**s),  
the number of times that the \(\eta_{\text{Mean}}^{\text{method}}\) in (29) gives \(\eta_{\text{Mean}}^{\text{Min}}\) is denoted by **N<sub>method</sub>**.

**Table 5** reports on \( N_{\text{OSDR1}}, N_{\text{RSSEP1}}, N_{\text{OSDR2}}, N_{\text{RSSEP2}}, N_{\text{CQR}}, N_{\text{QZ}} \) versus **n**.

When **n** changes from 50 to 300:
- \( N_{\text{CQR}} \) does not experience a meaningful change,
- \( N_{\text{QZ}} \) decreases from 25 to 0,
- \( N_{\text{OSDR1}} \) and \( N_{\text{RSSEP1}} \) (resp. \( N_{\text{OSDR2}} \) and \( N_{\text{RSSEP2}} \)) show competitive behaviors.
